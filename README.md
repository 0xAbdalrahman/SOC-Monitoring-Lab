# Splunk Lab Environment


## Description
I built a SOC Monitoring Lab, a small virtual SOC on VirtualBox. I deployed Ubuntu Server (Splunk), Windows Server with a domain controller, Windows 10 as a target machine, and Kali Linux for attacking purposes.

I configured Splunk and Sysmon, forwarded Windows event logs to the indexer, executed controlled attacks from Kali, and created Splunk dashboards, real-time alerts, and scheduled reports to detect, monitor, and investigate suspicious activity.

## Objective
- The objective of this lab is to provide a hands-on environment for practicing cybersecurity. Using VirtualBox, it runs Windows 10, Kali Linux, Windows Server, and Ubuntu Server to cover skills like network setup, endpoint monitoring, and security tool deployment with Splunk and Sysmon. 

- The lab includes offensive testing with Crowbar and Active Directory integration. On the defensive side, it focuses on installing and configuring Splunk, forwarding logs, creating dashboards, building reports, and setting up real-time alerts.
